# Axiom Data Science - Mini Challenges - React Data Table

Welcome and thank you for continuing the Axiom interview process!

We use this take-home coding challenge to supplement the interview process; it allows us to understand your abilities and experiences with different development tools and programming concepts without asking generic high level questions during a video interview. We have found it much more beneficial to let you showcase your abilities here, in actual code, as you would do if you were working here at Axiom.

## What should you do

This project is a self-contained React application with instructions for completing the
challenges. For more information, start the app!

```bash
# Install packages
npm install

# Start the app
npm run start
```

The project should open up your browser and the application. Instructions will be on the landing page. This application has been tested with `node` versions 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18.

This is intended to take less than 3 hours to complete, please don't spend more time than that. If you struggle or find that you have exceeded three hours please submit what you have completed and we will talk through it as is.

## What we are looking for

This challenge is designed gauge your experience level with `git`, `typescript/javascript`, `react`, and the general front-end development ecosystem. Come to the technical interview ready to talk about how you approached the tasks and what your thought process was for each. We are more interested in your problem solving methodology and how you approach debugging and working in code you have never seen before. We are less interested in how much faster you made the program.

If anything is confusing or ambiguous about this project, it wasn't meant to be. We are not trying to trick you, fool you, or waste your time. Please let us know if this is the case and we can talk through it and clarify any questions you may have.

## Submitting your work

Please submit your work via a GitHub project. You can upload the code to Github directly, fork this repository and push up to that fork, create your own new repository with your code and push to that, or really anything that works for you.

Our only requests are that you:

1. Submit your work in the form of a link to a GitHub repository that contains your solutions,
2. Make sure that your GitHub repository is public or you have invited users `kwilcox` and `srstsavage` with read permissions,
3. Do not open a pull request against the GitHub repository you were sent.

If you are struggling to upload your work to GitHub you may email us a .zip archive containing your solutions but we highly encourage you to take the GitHub route.
